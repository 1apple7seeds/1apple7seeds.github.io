        <p>Hello ! I'm Carlo Wiesse.\nI love drones and how these compact flying companions can provide information about their surroundings to help us solve so many problems.\nThe topic of my Master's thesis was learning-based visual-inertial localization systems for autonomous drones.\nFinally, I always look forward to joining a team of motivated and talented individuals. When I started my Master's, that team was the university robotics team. We won many national and international competitions together. So now I wish to join a new team as I believe we can achieve great things together.</p>
