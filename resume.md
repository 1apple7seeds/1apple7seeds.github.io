I recently earned my Master’s degree in the field of Computer Science with a focus on autonomous systems. During my Master’s, I joined Fraunhofer as a research assistant to learn about localization, path planning, and navigation for autonomous drones. I also joined the university robotics team and gained experience with object recognition and robot arm manipulation for autonomous mobile robots. I’m currently working on publishing my Master’s thesis at a scientific conference with the support of Fraunhofer and my university.
